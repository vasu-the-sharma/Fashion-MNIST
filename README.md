# Fashion-MNIST

What is Fasion-MNIST?
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset consisting of 70,000 images (60k training and 10k test) of clothing objects, such as shirts, pants, shoes, and more. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

The dataset was designed as a plug-and-play replacement for the traditional MNIST handwritten digit recognizing dataset. Both datasets use the same scale and type of image files, along with the same number of classification labels (10), for usage with machine learning models.
